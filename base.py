Space Complexity
- O(n): Each appended value creates a new Node object. In the worst case, all nodes are stored at once.
- O(1): Overhead for the dummy head and tail nodes.

Time Complexity
- append: O(1) – Constant time to insert at the tail.
- appendleft: O(1) – Constant time to insert at the head.
- pop: O(1) – Constant time to remove from the tail.
- popleft: O(1) – Constant time to remove from the head.
- isEmpty: O(1) – Just checks pointers.
